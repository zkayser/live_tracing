# LiveTracing

This repo contains a few different ways to trace LiveViews at different levels of granularity. 

On the main branch is run-of-the-mill auto-instrumentation provided through `OpentelemetryPhoenix`, along with
a few other spans generated by `OpentelemetryEcto` for effect. 

Other LiveView tracing strategies and options will be implemented on separate branches, which I will update here
as they become available.
